# Twitch React Queue

Twitch React Queue is a custom build of [twitch-clip-queue](https://github.com/jakemiki/twitch-clip-queue). It extends the original app with enhanced queue management, extra chat commands, and support for more media platforms - making it a versatile tool for streamers who want to manage and react to viewer-submitted content in real time. The project aims to add new capabilities while keeping the core experience simple and as close to the original as possible.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or improvements, feel free to open an issue or PR.

### Notes
*The name "Clip Queue" didnâ€™t make sense anymore since the app now supports many media types beyond clips. Because most creators use it for reaction content, "React Queue" felt more fitting - while also distinguishing this custom build from the original project. If you are looking for a stable version of Clip Queue, visit the original creator's [repository](https://github.com/jakemiki/twitch-clip-queue).*
