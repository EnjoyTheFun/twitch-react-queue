# Twitch React Queue

This is a personalized version of the app [twitch-clip-queue](https://github.com/jakemiki/twitch-clip-queue). It extends the functionality of the original app with features like enhanced queue management, additional Twitch chat commands, support for more media platforms (TikTok and Twitter/X), and importing URLs (which can be fed from Discord channels or other APIs). The project aims to add new capabilities while keeping the core experience simple and as close to the original as possible.

**Nothing about Twitch authorization has been changed from the original!**

If you have any cool ideas or improvements for the app open an issue!

*The name "Clip Queue" didn't make sense anymore since the app now includes more media types than just clips. Most creators who use the app use it for react content so "React Queue" felt more fitting. It also adds a way to differentiate between this custom build and the original app. If you are looking for a stable version of Clip Queue, visit the original creator's [repository](https://github.com/jakemiki/twitch-clip-queue).*

Intended for personal use, but you can test it out yourself here:
